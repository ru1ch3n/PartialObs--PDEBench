Instead of minimizing the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the PDE residuals, Delta-PINNs optimize a novel loss function based on the change (\"Delta\") of the mean of the residuals over training epochs. This approach focuses on driving the expectation of the residuals to zero in a monotonically decreasing fashion, effectively averaging out the effects of noise rather than fitting to it. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness, successfully solving forward and inverse problems even when the training data is corrupted with up to 100% noise.",

This \"network of networks\" learns to generate solutions for new parameters by linearly combining a very small set of these pre-trained basis solutions. The framework is non-intrusive and results in an extremely lightweight and fast surrogate model.",

Instead of tackling the challenging multiscale problem directly, NH-PINN employs a three-step process: (1) using PINNs with a proposed oversampling strategy to accurately solve the periodic cell problems at the microscale, (2) computing the effective homogenized coefficients, and (3) using another PINN to solve the much simpler macroscopic homogenized equation. This theoretically-grounded approach significantly improves the accuracy of PINNs for multiscale problems where standard PINNs typically fail.",

It reformulates the CMP problem as solving the Eikonal PDE on the constraint manifold, which is then solved using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). This approach is entirely data-free, requiring no expert demonstrations, and learns a neural function that can generate optimal, collision-free paths in sub-seconds. The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CMP techniques in speed and success rate on complex, high-dimensional tasks.",
