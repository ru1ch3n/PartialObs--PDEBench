The core idea is to decompose the solution into multiple components with different characteristic scales (e.g., low- and high-frequency) and use separate, specialized neural network streams for each component. These streams are trained jointly, allowing the model to efficiently and accurately learn complex solutions that standard PINNs fail to capture.", "contrib": [], "theory": [], "core_math": [], "pdes": [], "tasks": [], "baselines": [], "setting": [], "results_tables": [], "status": "index", "slug": "separable-physics-informed-neural-networks"}

This approach focuses on driving the expectation of the residuals to zero in a monotonically decreasing fashion, effectively averaging out the effects of noise rather than fitting to it. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness, successfully solving forward and inverse problems even when the training data is corrupted with up to 100% noise.", "contrib": [], "theory": [], "core_math": [], "pdes": [], "tasks": [], "baselines": [], "setting": [], "results_tables": [], "status": "index", "slug": "delta-pinns"}
