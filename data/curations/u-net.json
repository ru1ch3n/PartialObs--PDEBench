  "tldr": "U-Net is a symmetric encoder窶電ecoder convolutional network with skip connections that fuse high-resolution features from the encoder into the decoder. While originally proposed for biomedical segmentation, it is widely used as a baseline for dense prediction on grids (including PDE surrogate modeling and masked field reconstruction).",
  "problem": "Provide a fast, high-quality mapping from input images/tensors to output images/tensors when locality and multi-scale context matter. In AI4PDE, U-Net is a common baseline for grid-based surrogates and inpainting.",
  "benefits": [
    "Strong locality + multi-scale inductive bias; often competitive with more complex models on image-like PDE grids.",
    "Easy to train and deploy; compatible with many conditioning signals via concatenation.",
    "Good default backbone for diffusion denoisers and PDE inpainting models."
