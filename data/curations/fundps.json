  "tagline": "Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), but formulated for **function spaces** and PDE fields.",
  "tldr": "FunDPS adapts diffusion posterior sampling to PDE solution *fields*: sample from a learned diffusion prior while enforcing observations and (optionally) physics constraints through guidance terms. The key idea is to treat the unknown as a function (field) and make the guidance compatible with PDE operators and masks.",
  "problem": "Inverse problems for PDEs (inpainting, sparse sensors, data assimilation) require drawing samples of solution fields consistent with partial observations. Standard diffusion priors sample unconditionally; naive conditioning can be weak or expensive. FunDPS targets practical posterior sampling for PDE fields by combining diffusion priors with measurement/physics guidance in a function-space framing.",
  "benefits": [
    "Works naturally with **arbitrary masks / sparse sensors** via a measurement operator M.",
    "Guidance can incorporate **physics residuals** and/or observation likelihoods without retraining a new model for every mask.",
    "Function-space viewpoint encourages discretization-robust formulations (same method across grid resolutions)."
