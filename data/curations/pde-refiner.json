  "tagline": "Iteratively refine a coarse neural PDE prediction using a learned **residual/correction** module.",
  "tldr": "PDE-Refiner wraps an existing neural PDE solver with an iterative correction mechanism. Given an initial prediction, a refiner network predicts corrections based on the current state and (optionally) PDE residual/constraints, improving accuracy and long-horizon stability.",
  "problem": "Neural PDE solvers often accumulate error during rollouts or when asked to reconstruct missing data. Training a single forward pass model can be insufficient for high accuracy across many steps. PDE-Refiner targets this by explicitly learning a correction step that can be applied repeatedly.",
  "benefits": [
    "Turns many solvers into **iterative** solvers: accuracy can improve with more refinement steps.",
    "Can incorporate PDE residual signals, making corrections physically meaningful.",
    "Often improves long-horizon stability without dramatically increasing base model size."
