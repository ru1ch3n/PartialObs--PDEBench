tldr: GenCast produces probabilistic global weather forecasts (ensembles) using a generative model, improving medium-range accuracy and extremes prediction compared to operational ensembles in reported evaluations.
contrib:
- Generates ensemble forecasts and event probabilities rather than a single deterministic trajectory.
- Targets medium-range forecasting and extreme events.
- Demonstrates strong skill vs operational ensemble baselines in reported studies.
pdes:
- Atmospheric dynamics (primitive equations)
tasks:
- Probabilistic forecasting
- Extreme-event risk estimation
baselines:
- ECMWF ENS
- GraphCast
- Numerical solver
setting:
- Global weather forecasting at fixed grid/time step; trained on decades of reanalysis.
- Evaluation on many meteorological variables with probabilistic skill metrics.
