tldr: This work introduces a novel physics-informed framework for constrained motion planning (CMP) in robotics. It reformulates the CMP problem as solving the Eikonal PDE on the constraint manifold, which is then solved using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). This approach is entirely data-free, requiring no expert demonstrations, and learns a neural function that can generate optimal, collision-free paths in sub-seconds. The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CMP techniques in speed and success rate on complex, high-dimensional tasks.
