tldr: Poseidon explores scalable foundation-model training for PDE data with an emphasis on efficiency and transfer across PDE tasks.
contrib:
- Introduces a foundation-model training recipe specialized for PDE trajectories.
- Studies transfer/finetuning across PDE families and resolutions.
- Emphasizes efficiency (compute/memory) for large-scale PDE pretraining.
