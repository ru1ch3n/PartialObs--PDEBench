tldr: GraphCast is a graph neural network trained on reanalysis data to produce fast global weather forecasts, reported to outperform a leading numerical model on many evaluation metrics for medium-range horizons.
contrib:
- Graph-based representation of the globe to model atmospheric dynamics.
- Fast inference enabling rapid forecast generation.
- Strong reported skill compared to operational numerical weather prediction baselines.
pdes:
- Atmospheric dynamics (primitive equations)
tasks:
- Deterministic medium-range forecasting
baselines:
- ECMWF IFS
- Pangu-Weather
- FourCastNet
setting:
- Trained on ERA5 reanalysis; predicts multiple meteorological variables.
- Evaluated on medium-range horizons (days).
