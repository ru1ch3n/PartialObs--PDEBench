tldr: FNO learns PDE solution operators using Fourier-domain global convolutions, achieving strong accuracy and mesh-independent generalization on standard benchmarks.
contrib:
- Introduces Fourier layers to parameterize integral kernels efficiently.
- Demonstrates discretization-invariant operator learning (train low-res, test high-res).
- Becomes a standard baseline for PDE surrogate modeling.
