tldr: This paper introduces GPT-PINN, a novel meta-learning framework to drastically accelerate the solution of parametric PDEs for multi-query and real-time applications. It treats fully pre-trained PINNs, solved at adaptively selected parameter points, as activation functions or "neurons" in a hyper-reduced meta-network. This "network of networks" learns to generate solutions for new parameters by linearly combining a very small set of these pre-trained basis solutions. The framework is non-intrusive and results in an extremely lightweight and fast surrogate model.
