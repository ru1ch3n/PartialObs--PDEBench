tldr: PINO augments neural operators with physics-based constraints (PDE residuals), improving data efficiency and physical consistency for operator learning.
contrib:
- Combines operator learning with physics residual regularization.
- Enables training with sparse/noisy data and improves generalization.
- Popular baseline for partially observed PDE inference.
pdes:
- Burgers
- Navier–Stokes
- Kolmogorov flow
tasks:
- Forward operator learning
- Partial-observation reconstruction (community use)
baselines:
- FNO
- PINN
- DeepONet
setting:
- Adds PDE residual loss on collocation points.
- Often used when full-field supervision is limited.
