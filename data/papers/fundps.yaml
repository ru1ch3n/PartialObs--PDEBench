tldr: FunDPS introduces guidance in diffusion sampling directly on function spaces, enabling accurate PDE solution inference in as few as 1–2 steps on several benchmarks.
contrib:
- Formulates diffusion guidance on function spaces (not pixel grids) for PDE operators.
- Demonstrates strong 1–2 step sampling while keeping errors competitive.
- Applies to both forward and inverse (partial observation) PDE problems.
pdes:
- Darcy flow
- Poisson
- Helmholtz
- Navier–Stokes
tasks:
- Forward operator learning
- Inverse / partial-observation reconstruction
baselines:
- DiffusionPDE
- PINO
- FNO
- DeepONet
setting:
- Guided diffusion sampling; compares different step counts.
- Evaluated on standard PDE operator benchmarks; reports relative errors.
- Includes both forward and inverse settings depending on PDE.
