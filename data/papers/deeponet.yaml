tldr: DeepONet introduces a branch–trunk architecture to learn nonlinear operators and becomes a foundational approach for operator learning in PDE problems.
contrib:
- Branch–trunk decomposition to represent input functions and evaluation locations.
- Connects to universal approximation of operators.
- Demonstrates operator learning on PDE-like benchmarks and functionals.
pdes:
- Burgers
- Advection
- Reaction–diffusion
tasks:
- Operator regression
- Fast evaluation of solution fields
baselines:
- FNO
setting:
- Learns mapping from an input function (IC/forcing) to output function values.
- Often evaluated with scattered sensor inputs and queried outputs.
