# Paper summary template (YAML)
#
# Copy this file to: data/papers/<slug>.yaml
# Then fill in fields. The website generator reads *all* YAML files in
# data/papers/ and builds docs/.
#
# Tips
# - Keep lists short and specific.
# - Put the most important equation(s) in core_math (LaTeX, no $...$ needed).
# - If you don't know a field yet, leave it empty.

slug: example-paper-slug  # file name without .yaml is used if omitted
