tldr: 'This paper introduces Neural Homogenization-PINN (NH-PINN), a method that combines classical homogenization theory with PINNs to solve complex multiscale PDEs. Instead of tackling the challenging multiscale problem directly, NH-PINN employs a three-step process: (1) using PINNs with a proposed oversampling strategy to accurately solve the periodic cell problems at the microscale, (2) computing the effective homogenized coefficients, and (3) using another PINN to solve the much simpler macroscopic homogenized equation. This theoretically-grounded approach significantly improves the accuracy of PINNs for multiscale problems where standard PINNs typically fail.'
