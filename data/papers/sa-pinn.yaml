tldr: SA-PINNs introduce adaptive weighting for training points or loss terms to focus learning on hard-to-fit regions and improve convergence.
contrib:
- Self-adaptive weighting for residual and boundary losses.
- Reduces sensitivity to manual hyperparameter tuning.
- Improves learning on stiff or multi-scale PDE problems in reported tests.
pdes:
- Allen–Cahn
- Poisson
- Burgers
tasks:
- Forward PDE solve
baselines:
- PINN
setting:
- Learns weights jointly with network parameters; focuses sampling on difficult regions.
