tldr: CNO proposes a convolutional (non-Fourier) neural operator that performs competitively across a wide PDE suite including elliptic and time-dependent systems.
contrib:
- Defines an operator-learning architecture using only convolutions (no global Fourier mixing).
- Benchmarks across a broad PDE suite (Poisson, Wave, Navier–Stokes, etc.).
- Provides strong baseline performance with simple operations and good scaling.
pdes:
- Poisson
- Wave equation
