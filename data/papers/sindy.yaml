tldr: SINDy introduced sparse identification with a candidate library, enabling interpretable discovery of governing equations from data.
contrib:
- Sparse regression selects a small set of active terms from a large library.
- Produces interpretable discovered dynamics.
- Inspired many PDE discovery methods (e.g., PDE-FIND).
