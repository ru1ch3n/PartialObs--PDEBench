tldr: PRISMA turns PDE residuals into a frequency-aware attention signal inside a diffusion neural operator, aiming to preserve accuracy while cutting sampling steps.
contrib:
- Uses PDE residuals as *spectral attention* during diffusion sampling (guidance without extra solves).
- Targets the speed–accuracy tradeoff in diffusion-based PDE inference under sparse measurements.
- Shows improved quality vs prior diffusion guidance at low step counts on several PDE tasks.
pdes:
- Darcy flow
- Poisson
- Helmholtz
- Navier–Stokes
tasks:
- Forward operator learning
- Inverse / partial-observation reconstruction
baselines:
- FunDPS
- DiffusionPDE
- FNO
- PINO
- DeepONet
setting:
- Partial observation (masked measurements) with diffusion sampling.
- Reports results across different step counts (1–200).
- Emphasis on fast sampling with minimal quality degradation.
