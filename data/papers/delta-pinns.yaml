tldr: This paper introduces Delta-PINNs, a new training paradigm for PINNs designed to be highly robust to noisy data. Instead of minimizing the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the PDE residuals, Delta-PINNs optimize a novel loss function based on the change ("Delta") of the mean of the residuals over training epochs. This approach focuses on driving the expectation of the residuals to zero in a monotonically decreasing fashion, effectively averaging out the effects of noise rather than fitting to it. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness, successfully solving forward and inverse problems even when the training data is corrupted with up to 100% noise.
