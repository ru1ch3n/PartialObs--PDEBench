tldr: Neural operator work formalizes learning solution operators (function-to-function maps) and connects integral, Fourier, and graph-based variants.
contrib:
- Frames PDE surrogate learning as operator learning between function spaces.
- Connects several architectures (kernel/integral, Fourier, graph) under a common viewpoint.
- Provides theoretical and empirical grounding for resolution-invariant surrogate solvers.
pdes:
- Burgers
- Darcy flow
- Navier–Stokes
tasks:
- Operator learning (resolution generalization)
- Fast surrogate simulation
baselines:
- DeepONet
- FNO
setting:
- Highlights training on low-res and testing on higher-res (discretization-invariant).
- Emphasizes parametric PDE families and solution operators.
