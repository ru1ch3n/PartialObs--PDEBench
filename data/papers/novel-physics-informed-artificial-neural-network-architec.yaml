tldr: Proposes novel parallel and sequential PINN architectures to solve output-only system and input identification problems in structural dynamics. The method first discretizes the governing PDE into a set of modal ODEs using the Eigenfunction Expansion Method, then assigns individual, cooperating PINNs to each mode, significantly improving computational efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy for complex engineering inverse problems.
