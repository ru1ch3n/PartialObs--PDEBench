tldr: gPINNs incorporate gradient information (derivative residuals) into the training objective to mitigate error and improve convergence.
contrib:
- Augments PINN loss with gradient-based constraints.
- Improves approximation on some PDEs by adding extra supervision.
- Highlights connections between PINNs and higher-order residual enforcement.
pdes:
- Poisson
- Helmholtz
- Burgers
tasks:
- Forward PDE solve
- Inverse problems (some settings)
baselines:
- PINN
setting:
- Adds derivatives of PDE residuals to the loss; increases computational cost.
