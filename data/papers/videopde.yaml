tldr: VideoPDE reformulates PDE solution generation as spatiotemporal video inpainting, letting a single diffusion model handle both forward prediction and inverse reconstruction.
contrib:
- Casts PDE trajectories as videos and uses diffusion inpainting for conditioning.
- Handles both forward forecasting and inverse reconstruction in one unified framework.
- Demonstrates performance gains vs diffusion and operator baselines on several PDEs.
pdes:
- Wave equation
- Navier–Stokes
- Kolmogorov flow
tasks:
- Forward prediction
- Inverse reconstruction from sparse observations
baselines:
- DiffusionPDE
- FNO
- PINO
- DeepONet
setting:
- Spatiotemporal masking patterns (video inpainting).
- Reports both forward and inverse scenarios with MSE.
- Uses diffusion sampling at multiple step budgets.
