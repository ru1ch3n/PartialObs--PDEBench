tldr: FourCastNet applies Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) to global weather forecasting, showing that neural operators can produce high-resolution forecasts efficiently.
contrib:
- Introduces AFNO-based forecasting at global, high-resolution settings.
- Demonstrates strong accuracy–speed tradeoffs compared to earlier data-driven weather surrogates.
- Serves as a bridge between neural operator research and operational forecasting.
pdes:
- Atmospheric dynamics (primitive equations)
tasks:
- Deterministic forecasting
baselines:
- Persistence
- Numerical solver
setting:
- Trained on ERA5; predicts multi-channel meteorological fields.
- Evaluated on forecast skill across horizons and variables.
