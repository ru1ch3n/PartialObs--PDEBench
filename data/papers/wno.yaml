tldr: WNO uses wavelet transforms to build neural operators that better capture localized, multi-scale features in PDE solution operators.
contrib:
- Wavelet-domain representation for operator learning.
- Better handles localized/multi-scale structures than purely Fourier operators on some tasks.
- Extends neural operator benchmarking to a broader PDE set.
