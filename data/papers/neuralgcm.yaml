tldr: NeuralGCM combines neural components with GCM structure to model atmospheric dynamics, aiming for stable long rollouts and better climate statistics.
contrib:
- Hybridizes neural networks with a general circulation model structure.
- Targets stability for long rollouts (climate statistics), not only short-term accuracy.
- Demonstrates improvements on weather/climate metrics in reported experiments.
pdes:
- Atmospheric dynamics (primitive equations)
tasks:
- Weather forecasting
- Climate simulation / long rollouts
baselines:
- Traditional GCM
- GraphCast
setting:
- Long-horizon rollouts; evaluation on climate statistics and forecast skill.
- Hybrid model components trained from data while preserving physical structure.
